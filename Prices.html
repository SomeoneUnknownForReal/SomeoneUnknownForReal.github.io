        The prices will not multiply with amount of work until there's a lot going on (basically 3 or more). Read Terms to learn about supported payment methods.
        Prices are of course different depending on what currency you are paying. E.g. Countries of the European Union than use Euro have one digit less of the price USA/Canada has and Poland has the same digits, just in the zlotys.

        In some of the offers internet is required because of my skills. As I mentioned in the home page, I am more of a beginner programmer rather than advanced 10x developer.
