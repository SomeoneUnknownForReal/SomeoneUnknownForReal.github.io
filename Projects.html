      <p>I am a little intermediate programmer but I like to still call myself quite a beginner at coding. All the knowledge I have is self-thought. I like working on both small and big projects. I don't use ai chatbots to make me code. Tabnine better. I have kodezi but I don't use it.</p>
      <p>There are tabs on this site to navigate through comission prices, the projects I've done (as well as their downloads), terms and conditions and contact information. Have fun exploring the page (if you want).</p><br>
